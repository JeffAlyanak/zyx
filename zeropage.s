; =====	Zero-page RAM ==========================================================

; The first 256 bytes of RAM ($0000â€“$00FF) can be addressed by a special
; zero-page addressing mode, making it ideal for timing critical data.

; In this case, the NMI/vblank counter is stored here, so it can be written/read
; quickly.
