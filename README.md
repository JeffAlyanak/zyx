# NES ASM Example

## About
This basic NES example program can be used as an example on the basics of program structure, memory addresses, compilation/makefiles, etc in regards to NES development.

The nesdefs.inc and nesfile.ini are adapted from Anton Maurovic's NES Gamedev Examples which can be found here:

You can simply run `make` to compile, link and run the program.

Or:

* Use `make build` to compile and link.
* Use `make obj` to generate the object file.
* Use `make clean` to delete the compiled rom.
